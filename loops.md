# Control Flow in JavaScript

## for/of loop
This loop will execute 1 time for however many items there are in the collection you run it on. Example:

```
for (item of collection) {
  // run function on an individual item
}
```

## While loop
This loop will execute forever while the passed in condition is true. It will stop when the condition becomes false.

```
  while (condition == true) {
    // do this
  }
```

## If statement
An if statement will execute a specified block of code only if the passed in condition is true.

```
  if (condition == true) {
    // do this
  }
```

## If/else statement
Just like an if statement, but it will execute the else block of code if the condition evaluates to false.

```
  if (condition == true) {
    // run only if condition was true
  } else {
    // run only if condition was false
  }
```
